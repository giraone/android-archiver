```

## Result:

‚óè Implementation Complete

I've successfully implemented zoomable image functionality using TouchImageView. Here's what was added:

Changes Made:

1. Added TouchImageView dependency:
   - Added JitPack repository to settings.gradle.kts                                                                                                               
   - Added TouchImageView 3.6 to libs.versions.toml                                         
   - Added dependency to app/build.gradle.kts
2. Updated ImageDisplayContent in FileDisplayActivity:
   - Replaced standard Compose Image with AndroidView wrapping TouchImageView
   - Configured zoom settings (max zoom: 10x, min zoom: 1x)
   - Added proper error handling and logging for image loading
   - Maintained loading states and error display
3. Updated documentation:
   - Added TouchImageView to dependency list in CLAUDE.md
   - Documented zoomable image feature

Features:

- Pinch-to-zoom: Users can zoom in/out on images up to 10x magnification
- Pan support: Users can drag/pan around zoomed images
- Double-tap to zoom: Standard TouchImageView gesture support
- Smooth animations: Built-in smooth zoom and pan animations
- Memory efficient: Only loads bitmap when needed
- Error handling: Proper logging and error display for failed image loads

The zoomable image viewer will greatly improve the user experience when viewing images in the archiver app, allowing users to examine details in high-resolution images.
