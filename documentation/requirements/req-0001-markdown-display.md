# REQ-0001 Markdown Display

```
Implement this new requirement: The app should also display markdown files, when they are sent to the app. Use an appropriate icon in the list view.
```

## Result:

Implementation Complete

I have successfully implemented markdown file support for your Android archiver app. Here's what was added:

Changes Made:

1. Added MARKDOWN file type to FileType.kt enum
2. Enhanced file type detection in FileUtils.kt:
   - Added text/markdown MIME type detection
   - Added getFileTypeFromFileName() function to detect .md and .markdown extensions
3. Updated FileRepository to use the new detection logic and support markdown MIME type
4. Added markdown icon (Icons.Default.Info) in FileListItem.kt
5. Enhanced FileDisplayActivity to display markdown files using the existing Markwon library
6. Refactored MarkdownDisplay component to accept content parameter
7. Added comprehensive unit tests for markdown detection

Features:

- Markdown files (.md, .markdown) are now recognized and display with a distinctive icon
- Proper markdown rendering using Markwon library with formatting support
- Share intent support - markdown files shared to the app will be properly categorized
- Display functionality - markdown files show a "Display" option in the context menu
- Rendered output shows formatted markdown with headers, lists, links, etc.
