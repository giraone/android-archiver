# REQ-0002 Error Handling and Logging

```
 There is no good error handling ang logging yet, e.g. in file @app/src/main/java/com/giraone/archiver/data/FileRepository.kt in line 44 you should add a warn log with the exception.
```

## Result:

‚óè Perfect! I've added comprehensive error handling and logging throughout the FileRepository class. Here's what was improved:

Enhanced Error Handling & Logging:

1. Added logging import and TAG constant for consistent logging
2. Line 44 fix: Now logs warnings when file parsing fails instead of silently ignoring
3. loadFiles(): Added debug logging for directory creation and successful file loading
4. addFile(): Added debug logs for file addition and error logging if save fails
5. deleteFile(): Added debug/warning logs for delete operations and their outcomes
6. renameFile(): Added debug logs for rename operations and detailed error messages
7. parseFileItem(): Added validation logging for invalid file formats

Log Levels Used:

- Log.d(): Debug info (successful operations, progress updates)
- Log.w(): Warnings (parsing failures, operation failures)
- Log.e(): Errors (exceptions with stack traces)

The logging follows Android best practices with consistent TAG usage and appropriate log levels for debugging file operations and troubleshooting issues in production.
